<h1> PENALTIES</h1>
<h4>Penalty is a term in football which refers to punishment.<br>
A penalty kick is given against the team who makes a player perform 
one or more of the 9 violations that can 
be penalized by a player in his own penalty area
(FIFA football game rules, Rule 14 Penalty).<br></h4>
<br>
<h4>A-) 9 Violations:<br></h4>
<ol><li>If anyone kicks the opponent or attempts to kick.<br></li>
<li>If anyone trips up the opponent or attempts to do it.<br></li>
<li>If anyone jumps over the opponent player.<br></li>
<li>If anyone hits or attempts to hit.<br></li>
<li>If anyone tackles the opponent before touching the ball.<br></li>
<li>If anyone holds the opponent player.<br></li>
<li>If anyone spits out to the ground.<br></li>
<li>If anyone plays the ball purposefully with his hand.<br></li>
<li>If anyone curses to the opponent player.<br></li></ol>
<h2>B-) Penalty Kick:</h2>
<h4>The white spot where the shot is made is called the penalty point
 and all penalty shootings are made from the penalty point.The penalty 
 spot is 11 meters from the goal line. During the penalty shootout, 
 all players other than the opponent and the opponent must be outside 
 the penalty area. The goalkeeper cannot leave his own goal line until 
 he hits the ball. The ball is accepted in the game after returning 1 
 turn around its own. The player making the shot cannot touch the ball 
 a second time without playing another player.Even if the ball touches 
 the goalkeeper while passing through the goal posts, the goal is
 accepted.If the defending team fails in the event of a breach of the 
 rules above, the shot is repeated. Except for the penalty shooter, 
 when one of the attacking team players breaks the rules, the number 
 is canceled if the player has scored.The game normally resumes 
 unless the ball is rescued by the goalkeeper or otherwise scored.<br>
