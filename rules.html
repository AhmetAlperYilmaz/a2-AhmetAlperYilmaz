        <h1> FOOTBALL RULES</h1>
        <h2><strong>Field of Play</strong>:&nbsp;
The game can be played on
either natural or artificial surfaces, the surface must be green and
rectangular in shape.&nbsp; The two long sides of the rectangle are
called touch lines and the two shorter sides are called goal
lines.&nbsp; The field is divided in half by the halfway line.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Ball</strong>:&nbsp; Must be spherical, made of leather
(or similar) 68-70 cm in circumference and of a certain pressure.
&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Number of Players</strong>:&nbsp; Two teams of no more
than 11 players (one of which is the goalkeeper).&nbsp; A game cannot
start if either team has less than 7 players.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Equipment</strong>:&nbsp; Players must wear a jersey,
shorts, stockings, shinguards and footwear.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Referee</strong>:&nbsp; The referee ensures the Laws of
the Game are respected and upheld.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Assistant Referees</strong>:&nbsp; There may be at most 2
assistant referees.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Duration of the Match</strong>:&nbsp; The game is played
in 2 halves consisting of 45 minutes each.&nbsp; The half time interval
must not exceed more than 15 minutes.&nbsp; At the discretion of the
referee more time is allowed to compensate for any stoppage during play
e.g.&nbsp; Due to substitutions or care and attention of injured
players. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Start and Restart of Play</strong>:&nbsp;
A kick-off
starts play at the start of the match or after a goal.&nbsp; A kick-off
involves one player kicking the ball, from stationary,
forward from the centre spot.&nbsp; All players must be in their own
half
prior to kick-off.&nbsp; A coin is tossed pre-game,&nbsp; the team
which loses the toss are awarded the kick-off to start the game whilst
the team that win the toss are allowed to choose which direction they
want to play.&nbsp; After half time the teams switch direction and the
other team will kick-off.&nbsp; After a goal is scored, the team which
conceded the goal will kick-off to restart play.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Ball in and Out of Play</strong>:&nbsp;
The ball is out of play once a goal has been scored or when the referee
has stopped the game.&nbsp; The ball is in play at all other times.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Method of Scoring</strong>:&nbsp; The ball crosses the
goal line inside the goal mouth.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Offside</strong>:&nbsp;
It is an offence for a player to be in contact with the ball when they
are closer to the opponents' goal than both the ball and the
second-last opponent.&nbsp;&nbsp; The offside rule exists to ensure
there are always opponents (generally the goal keeper and a
defender)&nbsp; between a player receiving the ball and the goal.&nbsp;
Without the offside rule, play can become boring with repeated long
balls being kicked to a player stood next to the goalkeeper for an easy
goal.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Fouls/Misconduct</strong>:&nbsp; These are many and
varied, broadly speaking it is an offence to use excessive force whilst
playing the game either deliberately or undeliberately or to handle the
ball (unless you are a goal keeper).&nbsp; The referee may show the
yellow card to caution players for less serious offences and the red
card for more serious offences resulting in the player being sent
off.&nbsp; Two yellow cards are equivalent to one red card.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Free Kicks</strong>:&nbsp; Are given by the referee for
fouls and misconduct. A free kick can either be direct or
indirect.&nbsp; A goal can be scored directly from a direct free
kick.&nbsp; A goal can only be scored from an indirect free kick if it
touches at least one other player first.&nbsp; The free kick must be
taken from a stationary position with that position varying depending
on whether the free kick was given inside or outside the goal area and
whether it's direct or indirect.&nbsp; The opposing team must be a
minimum of 9.15 m from the ball when the free kick is taken.<br>
